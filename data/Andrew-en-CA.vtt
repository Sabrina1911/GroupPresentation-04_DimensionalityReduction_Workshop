Hi I'm Andrew Silvera.
Silvera and I worked on identifying

20a1d426-3a53-42b3-83e4-155f4f708f38-1
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:08.810
reducing redundancy in our data set

ede647e2-f240-477c-9848-fe74a3a1d50d-0
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.329
using a high correlation filter.
We eliminated variables with correlation

ede647e2-f240-477c-9848-fe74a3a1d50d-1
00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.905
coefficients above 0.9,
ensuring each feature contributes unique

ede647e2-f240-477c-9848-fe74a3a1d50d-2
00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:20.750
information.

eb1ea4e0-5229-45a1-bf24-c412a775d2cf-0
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.664
Next,
we visualize the relationships between

eb1ea4e0-5229-45a1-bf24-c412a775d2cf-1
00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:29.020
variables using a correlation heat maps,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.959
which provided a clear overview of how
certain years of or price indicators are

1a44338b-773f-414f-8948-868bb882cafd-1
00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:36.960
interrelated.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.413
Next,
we performed principal component analysis

c5092304-a7b2-405e-a0a0-bbe873725778-1
00:00:42.413 --> 00:00:44.420
to condense the remaining

890df78a-6f1d-4a59-98a1-c93d7c71a524-0
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.660
features into smaller

ab2ece20-241b-4777-93ce-601500dcce99-0
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.490
the number of principal components.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:59.148
Our screen plot showed just a few
components captured over 90% of the total

3769eb77-0bc2-42b7-8c30-d865df789c92-1
00:00:59.148 --> 00:01:03.798
variance,
significantly simplifying our data while

3769eb77-0bc2-42b7-8c30-d865df789c92-2
00:01:03.798 --> 00:01:06.260
retaining interoperability.
