Hello,
my name is Rohit and in this project I

a3fa650f-c846-4664-ab7b-0e32f84a1cfe-1
00:00:05.087 --> 00:00:10.734
applied two complementary method random
forestries and forward backward feature

a3fa650f-c846-4664-ab7b-0e32f84a1cfe-2
00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:15.040
selection to improve model performance
and interpretability.

e76b708e-3421-4531-b0ec-e456a3ba3794-0
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.012
So random forests are powerful enable
models that build many decision trees on

e76b708e-3421-4531-b0ec-e456a3ba3794-1
00:00:22.012 --> 00:00:24.880
random subsets of data and features.

5d4b5556-45d8-403f-abd2-159c110ea046-0
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.362
They help identify which variables have
the greatest predictive power by

5d4b5556-45d8-403f-abd2-159c110ea046-1
00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:35.460
calculating which feature importance
scores based on how much each feature

5d4b5556-45d8-403f-abd2-159c110ea046-2
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.160
reduces prediction error.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.685
Then,
using forward and backward feature

db6e4856-38f5-4a5b-9ab7-d7d1965e0852-1
00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:45.000
selection, I refined the model further.

731ee5bb-81af-4867-bd54-26738f3ea7b5-0
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.328
These methods iteratively add or remove
features,

731ee5bb-81af-4867-bd54-26738f3ea7b5-1
00:00:49.328 --> 00:00:55.860
evaluating performance at each step using
metrics like accuracy or R square to find

731ee5bb-81af-4867-bd54-26738f3ea7b5-2
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.960
the optimal feature subset.

207f358b-fd9b-45d3-aec6-a3752bb85ea9-0
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.064
Together,
these approaches balance accuracy and

207f358b-fd9b-45d3-aec6-a3752bb85ea9-1
00:01:02.064 --> 00:01:02.840
simplicity.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.094
Random forests reveal which features
matter most,

17954497-43ad-4b3c-afb8-e5782f52d4d8-1
00:01:07.094 --> 00:01:13.295
and feature selection ensures that we
only keep the one set truly matters and

17954497-43ad-4b3c-afb8-e5782f52d4d8-2
00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:15.760
which improve predictive power.
