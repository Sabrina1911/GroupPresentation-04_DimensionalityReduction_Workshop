CoHD_PPP,Cost of a healthy diet in PPP dollars,"The cost of a healthy diet indicator is the cost of purchasing the least expensive locally available foods to meet requirements for energy and food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) for a representative person within energy balance at 2330 kcal/day. The cost of a healthy diet is converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP). Data are available for the period from 2017 and 2024. PPP conversion factors are imputed by the FAO for years not available in the WDI database. PPPs are imputed in one or multiple years for the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Aruba, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Curaçao, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominica, Eswatini, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Liberia, Myanmar, Seychelles, Sint Maarten (Dutch part), Suriname, Tajikistan and Zimbabwe.

For Bahamas, Guyana, Haiti, Iran, Myanmar, Sint Maarten (Dutch Part), and Turks and Caicos Islands, retail food prices were not available from the ICP 2021. As a result, the CoHD for these countries is calculated using data from the ICP 2017.","Adapted from Herforth, A., Venkat, A., Bai, Y., Costlow, L., Holleman, C. & Masters, W.A. 2022.
