00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.000
OK, hello.

6b3c067f-a040-4fd9-a927-f2f696ed5648-0
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.871
First we tested our Canada's food
inflation over the six decades resulting

6b3c067f-a040-4fd9-a927-f2f696ed5648-1
00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:12.097
the P is less than 0.
05 and represent the significant upward

6b3c067f-a040-4fd9-a927-f2f696ed5648-2
00:00:12.097 --> 00:00:14.959
trends redefining our world CPA data sets.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.560
And similarly over here we can see
similar result as per the previous one.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.402
Today we have used a different data set
and we have different methods to change

942302e8-fd0e-415e-bfda-511fdc60ec50-1
00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:30.800
our to make our data set readable.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.961
First we have done with the missing value
filter which we have set the threshold of

dfe3d85d-a260-4c54-8027-cd5d152b8caa-1
00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:38.320
0.
4 at 40% like means 40% of missing value.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.360
If there are any columns and 40 version
missing value it will be removed.

7bbc7f1a-e3ee-46bf-a2a8-1f02eebf045b-0
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.596
Similarly with the low variance filter if
the threshold is 0 point less than the

7bbc7f1a-e3ee-46bf-a2a8-1f02eebf045b-1
00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:49.880
variant will be less than of 0.
01 it will be removed.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.572
In missing value filter we change the
another values with Nan value with the

69a9361e-e75e-427b-90c1-f5e30e2524a7-1
00:00:56.572 --> 00:01:03.068
medians and if you have to go to calling
of this function and we can see how we

69a9361e-e75e-427b-90c1-f5e30e2524a7-2
00:01:03.068 --> 00:01:09.320
did have calculated dropping missing
values if we have removed these columns

69a9361e-e75e-427b-90c1-f5e30e2524a7-3
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.680
from the table and also we have reshaped
the these filter values.

dec02642-e910-4376-9fd4-27b7edb8df5b-0
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.898
Similarly in the low variance,
we have changed the shape of the data set

dec02642-e910-4376-9fd4-27b7edb8df5b-1
00:01:20.898 --> 00:01:26.400
by removing checking the threshold and
this is the result for that one.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.080
Thank you.
