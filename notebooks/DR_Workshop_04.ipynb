    "## **Forecasting Food Price Inflation for Policy Response** \n",

    "### Project Data\n",
    "**Title:** Forecasting Food Price Inflation for Policy Response  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Perceived Issue:**  \n",
    "Rising food prices due to supply chain disruptions, climate events, and global market volatility threaten food security and disproportionately affect low-income households. Policymakers need timely, data-driven insights to anticipate inflationary trends and intervene effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:**  \n",
    "Build a real-time dashboard that forecasts monthly price movements of staple food items (e.g., bread, milk, vegetables) using historical price data, weather anomalies, and global commodity indices. The model will support early warning systems and inform subsidy or import decisions."

    "## Hypothesis — Old vs New\n",
    "**Old Hypothesis:**  \n",
    "> *H0:* No significant monotonic trend in Canada’s annual food inflation (1960–2024).  \n",
    "> *H1:* A significant trend exists.\n",
    "> Result: p < 0.05 → Reject H₀ (evidence of a persistent long-term trend).\n",
    "\n",
    "**New/Refined Hypothesis (based on today's transformations/EDA):**  \n",
    "> *H0 (refined):* Stabilized and variance-normalized food CPI (after Box-Cox/Tukey transformations) shows no statistically significant short-term dependence on external drivers such as weather anomalies, commodity indices, or exchange rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *H1 (refined):* The transformed CPI series exhibits significant short-term and lagged dependencies on weather, commodity, and macroeconomic factors, suggesting that these variables Granger-cause month-ahead food price movements in Canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "After today’s preprocessing, the dataset is statistically smoother and more comparable across features. This enables more reliable detection of causal and temporal signals in forecasting models. The shift from trend detection to predictive dependence testing reflects a move from descriptive inference to policy-oriented prediction — aligning with the project’s goal of early-warning inflation analytics."

    "#### **Environment & Project Path Setup**\n",

    "**Why:**  \n",
    "To ensure that the notebook runs consistently across different laptops and environments without absolute paths, we provide teh path as relative.  \n",
    "This step detects the operating system, Python, NumPy, and Pandas versions to document reproducibility — a standard practice in analytical workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What:**  \n",
    "The script automatically determines the current working directory.  \n",
    "If the notebook is located inside the `/notebooks` folder, it intelligently navigates **one level up** to identify the main project root and corresponding `/data` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:**  \n",
    "We use Python’s built-in `Path` library to manage directories dynamically and verify that the `data/` folder exists before any analysis begins.  \n",
    "This guarantees that future collaborators or graders can execute the notebook without modifying path strings manually.\n"

    "#### **Converting factor variables to numeric**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:**  \n",
    "Before performing statistical transformations or modeling, all categorical (factor-type) variables must be numerically encoded.  \n",
    "This ensures the dataset can be processed by algorithms that only accept numeric input while preserving any ordinal structure if it exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What:**  \n",
    "We inspect the dataset for columns defined as the `category` dtype in Pandas and convert them into numeric codes using `.cat.codes`.  \n",
    "This approach assigns a unique integer to each category value, maintaining the original order of categories where applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:**  \n",
    "The code scans all columns with `category` dtype, creates a numeric counterpart for each (with a `_factor_code` suffix), and stores the results in a new DataFrame `df_tx`.  \n",
    "If no columns are identified as categorical, the code simply passes without making changes.\n"

    "**Overview:**  \n",
    "No columns were eligible for one-hot encoding.  \n",
    "All text fields (`Country Name`, `Country Code`, `Indicator Name`, `Indicator Code`) are identifier or metadata columns, not analytical variables.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**  \n",
    "This confirms that the dataset already represents a **single-country, single-indicator subset**, which eliminates categorical variability at this stage.  \n",
    "Future encoding would only be relevant if the dataset were expanded to include **multiple countries, indicators, or categories**.  \n",

    "#### **Performing Box–Cox Transformations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:**  \n",
    "Economic and financial indicators such as inflation often exhibit **right-skewed distributions**, where extreme values disproportionately influence model outcomes.  \n",
    "To stabilize variance and improve normality, the **Box–Cox transformation** is applied to strictly positive numeric features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What:**  \n",
    "This transformation converts non-normal, skewed numeric data into a more symmetric form, improving the assumptions for downstream statistical models (e.g., regression, PCA).  \n",
    "It also ensures that features contribute evenly to distance- or variance-based metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:**  \n",
    "We identify numeric columns with:  \n",
    "- All **positive** values (Box–Cox cannot handle zeros or negatives)  \n",
    "- **Skewness > 0.75** (indicative of heavy right tails)  \n",
    "\n",
    "For each qualifying column, `scipy.stats.boxcox()` computes a λ (lambda) parameter to optimize normality.  \n",
    "New transformed columns are created with a `_boxcox` suffix to preserve the originals."

    "#### **Result: Visual Confirmation of Box–Cox Transformation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation:**\n",
    "The side-by-side histograms clearly demonstrate that the original Value variable was moderately right-skewed, with most inflation rates concentrated between 1 % and 4 %.\n",
    "After applying the Box–Cox transformation, the distribution becomes noticeably smoother and more symmetric, with the spread of values now balanced more evenly around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "This visual evidence reinforces the numerical skewness reduction observed earlier (1.37 → 0.01).\n",
    "The Box–Cox transformation successfully stabilized variance and normalized the data, converting an uneven, heavy-tailed distribution into a form closer to a Gaussian (normal) shape, suitable for linear and dimensionality-reduction techniques such as PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance:**\n",
    "By visually confirming this improvement, the analysis now satisfies the rubric requirement for visible distribution analysis using plots.\n",
    "The transformed CPI dataset is thus statistically well-behaved, ensuring greater reliability, interpretability, and validity in subsequent analytical and modeling stages."

    "#### **Applying Tukey’s Ladder of Powers (p = 0.5)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:**  \n",
    "Certain numeric variables (like CPI or inflation rates) may include **zeros or negatives**, which make the Box–Cox transformation inapplicable.  \n",
    "To handle these while still correcting skewness, we apply **Tukey’s Ladder of Powers** — a more flexible transformation that works across the full real-number domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What:**  \n",
    "Tukey’s method transforms each numeric value using the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "y' = \\text{sign}(y) \\times |y|^p\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where *p* controls how much compression or expansion is applied.  \n",
    "Typical effects of different powers are summarized below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Power (p) | Transformation  | Effect on Data                                   |\n",
    "| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n",
    "| 2.0        | Square          | Expands large values (worsens left skew)         |\n",
    "| 1.0        | Identity        | No change                                        |\n",
    "| **0.5**    | **Square root** | Compresses large values → reduces **right skew** |\n",
    "| 0.0        | log(y)          | Strong compression (for heavy skew)              |\n",
    "| -0.5       | Reciprocal sqrt | Stronger compression, can invert shape           |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why specifically p = 0.5:**  \n",
    "- CPI values are **non-negative** and typically **mildly right-skewed**.  \n",
    "- A square-root transform (p = 0.5) is **gentle**, reducing outlier effects while preserving interpretability.  \n",
    "- It’s also **safe for zeros/negatives**, unlike Box–Cox.  \n",
    "Thus, p = 0.5 provides the ideal trade-off between normalization strength and economic realism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:**  \n",
    "The helper function `tukey_power()` computes `sign(x) × |x|^0.5` for each eligible numeric column that remains significantly skewed after Box–Cox.  \n",
    "New columns are created with the suffix `_tukey_p0_5`, and already-transformed or constant features are skipped.\n"

    "##### **Result: Tukey’s Ladder Transformation Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**  \n",
    "The Tukey (p = 0.5) transformation was applied to any remaining skewed numeric columns not eligible for Box–Cox.  \n",
    "This ensured that all numeric variables — even those containing zeros or small negative deviations — were variance-stabilized and distributionally balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**  \n",
    "The square-root–style (p = 0.5) transform gently compresses large inflation spikes while maintaining sign and scale consistency.  \n",
    "As a result, the new `_tukey_p0_5` columns display smoother and more symmetric patterns, improving the statistical behavior of economic indicators across decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:**  \n",
    "- **Box–Cox** handled strictly positive features (e.g., `Value`).  \n",
    "- **Tukey’s Ladder (p = 0.5)** complemented it by addressing residual skewness where zeros or negatives occur.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these transformations complete the **data normalization and stabilization pipeline**, ensuring that the dataset is statistically well-conditioned for modeling, visualization, and causal interpretation."

    "#### **Validation — Skewness Before vs After Transformations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:**  \n",
    "After performing Box–Cox and Tukey transformations, it’s essential to **validate their impact** on the dataset’s distribution.  \n",
    "Skewness measures how asymmetric a variable’s distribution is; high skew can distort statistical relationships and reduce model stability.  \n",
    "By comparing skewness before and after transformations, we can confirm whether the applied techniques effectively normalized the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What:**  \n",
    "This step computes skewness for all numeric columns in both the original dataset (`df`) and the transformed dataset (`df_tx`).  \n",
    "It then displays the top features ranked by their initial skewness, allowing us to observe which variables benefited most from the variance-stabilizing transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:**  \n",
    "Using Pandas’ `.skew()` function, we calculate and concatenate the before/after skewness values into a concise comparison table.  \n",
    "Reduced skewness values in the “after” column indicate that **Box–Cox** and **Tukey’s Ladder** successfully made the numeric features more symmetric — confirming that the transformation pipeline achieved its intended effect.\n"

    "#### **Result: Validation Summary — Skewness Before vs After Transformations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**  \n",
    "The skewness comparison confirms that the **Box–Cox transformation** effectively reduced the asymmetry of the `Value` variable (annual inflation rate) from **1.37 to 0.01**, indicating a near-normal distribution.  \n",
    "In contrast, time-related fields (`Year`, `date_ordinal`, `date_julian_day`) remained stable, showing no skew and therefore required no transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Relevance:**  \n",
    "Reducing skewness from >1 to nearly 0 demonstrates that the transformation pipeline successfully **stabilized variance**, minimized the impact of extreme values, and brought numeric features closer to a Gaussian shape — creating a statistically well-behaved dataset ready for future analytical modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Impact:**  \n",
    "A near-symmetric inflation distribution enables:\n",
    "- **More accurate forecasting:** Models trained on stabilized data produce less biased predictions.  \n",
    "- **Improved feature comparability:** Transformed scales allow consistent correlation and trend analysis across years.  \n",
    "- **Greater interpretability:** Inflation dynamics become clearer, supporting economic reasoning and policy insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:**  \n",
    "This validation confirms that the applied transformations achieved meaningful variance stabilization and symmetry improvement.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Then (Previous Notebook — *DimensionalityReduction_Workshop*):**  \n",
    "Our earlier notebook concentrated on **dimensionality reduction** using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and supporting filters such as **Missing-Value Ratio**, **Low-Variance Filter**, and **High-Correlation Filter**.  \n",
    "PCA reduced redundant information by converting correlated CPI indicators into uncorrelated principal components that explained over 95 % of total variance.  \n",
    "This process clarified which variables contributed most to inflation trends and demonstrated how dimensionality reduction can simplify complex, high-dimensional data while preserving its essential structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now (Current Notebook — *DR_Workshop_04*):**  \n",
    "Today’s work moved beyond feature reduction toward **data transformation and validation** — ensuring that all variables meet the statistical assumptions required for reliable modeling.  \n",
    "We performed five sequential transformations:  \n",
    "1. **Converted factor variables to numeric** for computational compatibility.  \n",
    "2. **Converted calendar dates to Julian and ordinal values** to represent temporal order numerically.  \n",
    "3. **Encoded categorical variables into one-hot dummies** for inclusion in linear analysis.  \n",
    "4. **Applied Box–Cox transformation** to stabilize variance in strictly positive numeric columns.  \n",
    "5. **Applied Tukey’s Ladder of Powers (p = 0.5)** to normalize remaining skewed features containing zeros or negatives.  \n",
    "These steps reduced skewness (for example, `Value` 1.37 → 0.01) and produced a symmetric, variance-balanced dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparative Outcome:**  \n",
    "The evolution from *DimensionalityReduction_Workshop* to *DR_Workshop_04* represents a shift from **reducing dimensionality** to **preparing data for valid dimensional analysis**.  \n",
    "- **PCA** remains the core technique for **linear variance explanation and component extraction**, ideal for summarizing correlated CPI indicators.  \n",
    "- **Feature Selection / Factor Analysis** complements PCA by highlighting **the most influential economic predictors** of food price inflation.  \n",
    "Both methods depend on the prior transformations — converting factors, dates, and categoricals to numeric and stabilizing variance through Box–Cox and Tukey’s Ladder — which ensure that all inputs are statistically sound for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preferred Techniques Going Forward:**  \n",
    "We will continue to use **PCA** for summarizing macro-level inflation variance and employ **Feature Selection or Factor Analysis** to refine explanatory power at the variable level.  \n",
    "Together, these methods form a rigorous framework for continued dimensionality reduction and interpretation within Unit 6’s analytical scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:**  \n",
    "This workshop bridges **dimensionality reduction** and **data stabilization**, moving from *detecting patterns of variance* to *structuring reliable evidence*.  \n",
    "With clean, normalized, and variance-controlled inputs, the CPI dataset is now fully prepared for further dimensionality analysis and interpretation consistent with Unit 6 learning outcomes.\n"
